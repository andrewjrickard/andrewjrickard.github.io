  <p>I used to have an online commonplace book at this domain, where I quoted and translated from various musty old tomes. I called it <i>Graveyard Masonry</i>, after a line from one of &#8202;W. E. Henley’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/viewsreviewsessa01henluoft/page/80/mode/2up" target="_blank">essays</a>  in which he said that the translator is “too often a common graveyard mason that would play the sculptor.”</p>
    
  <p>After ten years I realized that the practice had changed the way I read, and not for the better. I often caught myself &#8202;just trufflehounding through a work in search of something clever to post. Sometimes I would refrain from recording an author’s remarks on a contentious subject, lest I draw the ire of <i>bien pensants</i>.</p>

  <p>In any case, the quality of my notes declined when they were made public. To eliminate this observer effect I have gone back to keeping my literary journal the old-fashioned way — in private, and on paper.</p>

  <p>I still maintain a blog at <a href="https://oboluspress.com/blog/" target="_blank">The Obolus Press</a>, albeit with a much narrower focus. If you’d like to stay in touch and be notified whenever I publish a new translation, please follow along there.</p>
